## The BLERF Lab Handbook

**NOTE** This is a work in progress!  

* * *

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to The Biodiversity and Landscape Ecology Research Facility (BLERF) Lab at UBC's Okanagan campus!

This lab handbook is a living document that sets out our community guidelines, values, shared principles, and expectations. If you’re here because you’re curious about the lab (woohoo!), the handbook will give you a sense of who we are and whether our research community is one you’d like to become part of. All new BLERF members should read the handbook upon joining the lab.

* * *

## Territory, Acknowledgements, Support

We respectfully acknowledge that we live and work on the traditional and unceded territory of [Syilx Okanagan](https://www.syilx.org/about-us/syilx-nation/) people. We are guests in this territory and through co-developed collaborations we strive continually to foster respectful and reciprocal relations with our Syilx hosts and with other Indigenous communities in the region. You can view the traditional territories of Indigenous Peoples [here](https://native-land.ca/). 

Find more information about UBC’s Declaration of Truth and Reconciliation commitments [here](https://ok.ubc.ca/about/indigenous-engagement/), The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's Calls to Action [here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/indigenous-people/aboriginal-peoples-documents/calls_to_action_english2.pdf), and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (DRIPA) [here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/indigenous-people/new-relationship/united-nations-declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples).

## Areas of Research

Here in the BLERF lab, our research often spans many disciplines and areas of research. Below we have listed a few of our current interests. However, we are always open to exploring new areas of research!

* The Historical/biogeographical perspectives on associations between plants and mycorrhizal fungi
* Landscape connectivity and biodiversity conservation
* Historical and biogeographical influences over local communities
* Invasive species ecology and biocontrol
* Increasing the openness and transparency of scientific research via the open science movement
 
## Lab Mission and Core Values

**Mission** 

* TBC 

**Core Values**
 
* *Respectful community*: The BLERF lab aims to provide an inclusive and safe environment for all community members. We encourage open, honest communication. While we may disagree at times, each member has a responsibility to act respectfully and each member will be treated with respect.  
 
 * *Student agency* : We believe students deserve the opportunity to take up self-directed research or pursue knowledge mobilization initiatives on which they themselves are leaders or curators, supported by resources and mentorship, and given appropriate credit.

 * *Transparency, Openness, and Reproducibility*: 

 * *Generosity*: Generosity underpins our practice. We are committed to lifting each other up and celebrating each other’s successes. 
 
 * *Work-life balance*: We value setting clear work boundaries and making time for friends, family, and hobbies outside of academic life.

* * *

## Prospective Students

### Personal Finances 
 
* How Much you make?  

    * Minimum stipends: 
        * MSc: $21,000 (to be increased in 2025)
        * PhD: $24,000 (to be increased in 2025)

* **A portion of this minimum stipend comes from Teaching Assistantships** 

* **Tuition costs are taken from the minimum stipend, so your "take home pay" will be the minimum stipend minus the costs of tuition**. 

* [COGS cost of living estimator](https://cogsubco.shinyapps.io/UBCO-CoGS_Expense_Calculator/)

* Rough idea of rent in Kelowna as of 2023: 

    * \$800-1000 for 1 bedroom in a shared house (with a shared bathroom)
    * \$1200+ for a master bedroom in a shared house (with a private bathroom)
    * \$1500+ for a studio/microsuite
    * \$1800+ for a 1 bedroom apartment
    * \$2500+ for a 2 bedroom apartment

* Tuition:
    * Master's and Doctoral:
        * $2000 per semester (\$6000 per year). 
        
        * International: ca. $3200 per semester ($9600 per year)  
        **HP: If an international student could please confirm this based on their experience that would be great**

**Kelowna**
* Links to info on Kelowna?
* Weather?
    * Clothing
        * Waterproof/water resistant boots for winter
        * Winter jacket, options for layering

* * *

## Code of Conduct

*Diversity is a fact* 

Just like life is diverse, so are we. Everyone is welcomed independently of their culture, religion, race and colour, sexual orientation, gender identity, differing abilities, and mental health status, personal and academic background, age, economic status or body appearance. 

*Inclusion is an act* 

 - Use the preferred pronouns if you know someone. Otherwise, prefer a gender-neutral language.
 - Put an effort in correctly pronouncing people’s names. There is no shame in mispronouncing names, as long as you try your best. 
 - Allow personal space, and respect others' privacy. Be self-conscious of your language and behaviour.
 - Develop a land acknowledgment and identify your positionality (you can consult this UBC [resource](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/distance-research-xwi7xwa/landacknowledgements))
 - If you realize you've erred, apologize quickly and move forward. 
 - But most importantly, ***be kind***. 

*Equity is the outcome*

We hope to create a mutually supportive community, a safe and inclusive environment, a place where you can feel at home. You are valued, and your ideas and work are valued. 

Other key considerations:

 - Inclusion/accessibility during meetings (lab and others as needed)
    - closed captioning for talks 
    - varied ways to participate
    - accommodating dietary restrictions and preferences
    - other
 - Health & safety
 - Ethics
 - Sustainability
 - Professionalism

* * *

## Communication

### Email 

* We use email for all official correspondence (e.g. regarding milestones, pay, HR issues, etc...) and/or longer communications.

### Slack 

* All lab members are required to create a [Slack](https://slack.com/) account and join the BLERF Lab Slack channel. This searchable platform is how we communicate with each other day-to-day. The lab has a main channel (#general) that includes every member associated with the lab. There exists many other channels and sub-channels where students can ask project-related questions, share updates, documents, etc. 

* Tap on "Add Channel" to browse existing channels you may not have been added to, or to create a new channel. DM groups can also be created with up to 8 individuals.  

### Google Calendar

* We schedule using the Google calendar, which you can find [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=m6li4d1nmkrvipp1a93jn5lko0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FVancouver).

* * *

## Meetings

### Lab Meetings

* During the school year, the BLERF lab hosts a weekly lab meeting. These lab meetings are typically 60 minutes and cover a range of topics. The meeting schedule can be found at the [BLERF OSF](https://osf.io/64cwf/wiki/Lab%20meetings/).  

* During the summer, these lab meetings typically become more sporadic as lab members are away on vacation or busy with fieldwork.  

* Often students and faculty from other labs will join these weekly meetings.  

### One-on-one Meetings 

* Apart from the weekly lab meeting, members of the BLERF lab usually have individual weekly meetings with Jason. 

* Students are expected to generate an agenda in advance of these meetings. This agenda helps ensure that we make the most of our meeting time. 
* Meeting agendas and notes should be posted on OSF for accountability (for both student and supervisor)

* * *

* * *

## Preregistration

We aim to complete preregistrations for most new research projects in the BLERF lab. 

Preregistration is the practice of documenting your research plan at the beginning of your study and storing that plan in a public repository. Completing a preregistration helps improve the transparency and reproducibility of your research.

Below are a few useful resources for preparing your own preregistration:  

* Example preregistration from the BLERF lab: [Here](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MK3QE). 
* Guide to creating a preregistration on OSF: [Here](https://help.osf.io/article/145-preregistration). 
* More example preregistrations submitted by BLERF members: [Here](https://osf.io/64cwf/wiki/BLERF%20Pre-registrations/). 

To add: remember to put statement about data management/archiving in pre-reg, i.e. in Dataverse

* * *

## BLERF Server

The BLERF Server (the “P” drive) should be used for regular (at least weekly) backup of all your work.

See the folowing guide on how to gain access: [Here](https://knowit.ok.ubc.ca/article/how-to-access-your-research-folder-p-drive-1088.html). 

**Note:** Before you attempt to access the BLERF server, ask Jason if you have been provided access. 

When you do get access, please go to the BLERF > Students folder, and create a new folder using your last name as the folder name. That’s where you’ll store all your stuff. Remember to follow best practices in data management. At the very least, create a `README.txt` file for every directory you create.

## Authorship Conventions

A very general guideline is that authorship is warranted if a person contributes to at least two of these: 

* Designing the study. 
* Acquiring the data. 
* Analyzing the data. 
* Writing the paper. 

**All authors** must agree on what is finally submitted for publication, and must agree to be fully accountable for what is submitted.

However, the most important advice is that authorship should be discussed at the outset of any collaboration. 

## Data Ownership Conventions

In general, data collected as part of BLERF activities will be archived on Dataverse, and publicly accessible (sometimes after a suitable embargo period).

The primary collectors of the data (e.g. graduate students) are, by default, expected to maintain rights to the data, as will the primary advisor (Dr. Pither), who will be the steward of the data unless otherwise arranged at the outset of the collaboration.

Exceptions to these general policies include: 

* Data collected as part of partnerships with Indigenous partners, who will decide if, how, and by whom data will be archived and accessed, following [OCAP Principles](https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/).
* Sensitive data of any sort, which will be managed according to appropriate jurisdictional guidelines.

Please also consult UBC's guidelines about [authorship and data ownership](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/intellectual-property-guide/joint-authorship-or-inventorship).  That same webpage has lots of other good resources!

## Other Resources
* [Paying taxes in Canada][2] - A short guide with relevant information if you just moved to Canada.
    *  For US students who have income within the year from the US - you will likely need to seek outside help with taxes (the UBCO tax clinic will not help you). Do this as soon as you get your tax forms!
* Car insurance: because you are a student, you're not required to register your vehicle in BC nor get BC insurance (though do check that your insurance does cover accidents outside of your home country). ICBC does require you to get an exemption to the insurance/registration requirement within 30 days of arrival: [ICBC insurance for students](https://www.icbc.com/insurance/moving-travelling/Pages/insurance-students-military-tourists.aspx)
